# Machine Learning for Face Recognition

<br>

A Python Notebook to explore classic Machine Learning methods - classification, clustering, PCA - for Face Recognition.

<br>

The dataset is made of 52 people with 10 black & white pictures per person ( = 520 total). Although it is a small dataset, it is still enough to play around with Machine Learning and get nice results !
