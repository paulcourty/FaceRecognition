<h1>Machine Learning for Face Recognition</h1>

<br/>

A Python Notebook to explore classic Machine Learning methods - classification, clustering, PCA - for Face Recognition.

<br/>

The dataset is made of 52 people with 10 black & white images for each (520 pictures total). Although it is a small dataset, it is still enough to play around with Machine Learning and get nice results.

A sample of the classification results:
